# Theoretical Elaboration

## Description

This project is in the context of a study project for a scientific approach for developing a chess AI. Therefore we will evaluate needed technologies, realize our project and document our used technologies and theoretical backgrounds as well as the implementation itself. Finally we will evaluate our results on the basis of our defined requirements and criteria.

This repository is for the documentation of our project. Thereby we will first give the scientific backgrounds and basic technologies. After that we will explain our implementation in detail and last evaluate our results compared to our requirements.
